            The first words of this yet to be published webpage, the core
            concept of this website call it a blog or a newsletter, is to
            discuss topics usually avoided by the general public. This webpage
            concerns over its reader&apos;s life and only seeks to present
            articles of causes and effects. Through my words if I am able to
            help a single person out there in the lonely world of digital world,
            I would consider it as a service worthy of its name. I may publish
            articles sporadically but they would always hit its true intent, to
            help its readers.
